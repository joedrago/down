This directory should contain the following:

* cocos2d-x: cocos2d-x git repo
  * git clone https://github.com/joedrago/cocos2d-x.git
  * (inside dir) git submodule update --init
  * Not a submodule for down because it is unnecessary/heavy for web development

* tools: see README.txt in tools for contents of this dir


Once all directories are prepared, you should be able to run buildenv_android.bat and run:
  * apkbuild
  * apkinstall
